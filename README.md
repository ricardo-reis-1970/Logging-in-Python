# Real Python â€” Logging in Python

This is a redo of the original source files for the small, compact and absolutely excellent course (Logging in Python)[https://realpython.com/courses/logging-python/], by Austin Cepalia from Real Python. Here are the (source files)[https://realpython.com/python-logging/], by Abhinav Ajitsaria, also with Real Python.

While looking at the source code, I was faced with some doubts and challenges and I decided to write what I hope to be a slightly improved version of these.

The original files bear the intended names, whilst the alternative versions are prefixed by `my_`.
